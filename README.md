[![Netlify Status][netlify-status]][netlify-deploys]

Yet another incarnation of [my personal website][laymonage], (re)built with
[Svelte][svelte], [SvelteKit][sveltekit], [TypeScript][typescript], and
[Tailwind][tailwind]. It is currently based on the [previous
incarnation][apex], which uses [Vue][vue]. I am planning to settle down with
this setup for quite a while, so this website will eventually include most of
my blog posts from all the previous "personal websites" I built.

## Setup

1. `npm install`: install dependencies
2. `npm run dev`: compile and hot-reload for development
3. `npm run build`: compile and minify for production
4. `npm run lint`: lint and fix files
5. `npm start`: serve the compiled build without hot reload
